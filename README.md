## About

Tank Battles, a 3D game, is a repository that includes many of the fundamentals of game development with Unity. 
The game is not a completely finished project as it is purely for educational purposes. It is a project that includes many game development fundamentals on a single game scene. It is shared as an exemplary resource for those who are introduced to game programming and learn the basics.

## Gameplay

- The game consists of two different tanks ( Player Tank and AI Tank ), one managed by the player and the other moving with artificial intelligence.
- The AI Tank patrols between two waypoints until it detects the player as a target. 
- If the Player Tank enters the AI Tank perspective, the AI Tank starts to chase the player.
- The AI Tank starts shooting when it close enough to attack while chasing.
- As with AI Tank, the Player Tank can shoot by pressing the `spacebar`.

## Features
The project includes implementations of several features. The most important:
 
- Keyboard and Mouse Input
- Finite State Machines (Patrol, Chase, Shoot)
- AI Sensory Systems (Sense, Perspective, Touch)
- 3D Physics
- Raycasting
- Navigation and Pathfinding (NavMesh)
- Interpolation
- 3D health bar
- Shooting
- Partical Effect (Explosion)
- Audio
